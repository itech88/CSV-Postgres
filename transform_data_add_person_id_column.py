"""Consider establishing a connection with your Postgres database using libraries like psycopg2 
or SQLAlchemy. Once connected, you can write SQL queries or use ORM capabilities 
(if using SQLAlchemy) to fetch the relevant IDs for the names in your dataframe.
After fetching the IDs, you can replace the 'Unknown' values with the correct IDs.
But remember, direct database calls can slow down the processing, 
especially if you're fetching IDs row by row. Consider fetching all the IDs you need in one go, 
and then mapping them to the dataframe in a vectorized way using pandas functionalities."""
